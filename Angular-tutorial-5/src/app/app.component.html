<!-- If there is any css style formate in app.css then it is only applicable for app.html....
but it is not applicable for any chaild functions.

if we want to style the profile.html we have to write code in profile.css...

if we want to apply the whole body. then we can write code in styles.css which is already pre installed. -->
